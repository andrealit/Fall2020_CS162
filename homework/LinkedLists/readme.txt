Class: CS 162
Project: Linked List #5

Description: 
- Completed sort_ascending() with recursive merge sort
- Didn't use Big Three or dynamic memory
- Extra credit #1 with template class, allowing user to select unsigned int. Interesting thing is, the large prime will take a bit longer so, wait a bit before it prints out the number of primes.
- Extra credit #2 with sort_descending() being done with recursive selection sort.
- If TA Milan is reading this, I solved the length problem by recounting the nodes at the print function
- Last four functions deal with user input and gameplay cycles.
- I used push_back() for the auto adding to the list.
- Separated Merge and Selection Sort with helper functions.
- Primes: any non-negative number greater than 1 that is only divisible by itself and one.
- No valgrind leaks when I tested it with various lengths and sorts.

Have a good break! Thanks for being awesome TAs.
